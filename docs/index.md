# Advanced Color Picker Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Advanced Color Picker component found in [Core](https://coregames.com) Community Content.

This component will help make your game more customizable for your players.  

If you want to get up and running quickly, then read the Quick Start guide, otherwise I would recommend reading he Need to Know and then try out the examples that come with the content.
